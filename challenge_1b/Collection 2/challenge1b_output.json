The form author provides XML signing, validating, or \nclearing instructions for form events, such as button click, file save, or submit.  \nXML data signatures conform to the W3C XML -Signature standard. Like PDF digital \nsignatures, XML digital signatures ensure integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in \ndocuments.  \nHowever, PDF signatures have multiple data verification states. Some states are called when a \nuser alters the PDF -signed content. I n contrast, XML signatures only have two data verification \nstates, valid and invalid. The invalid state is called when a user alters the XML -signed content.  \n \nEstablish long -term signature validation \nLong -term signature validation allows you to verify the s ignature's validity long after the \ndocument was signed. To achieve this, all the necessary elements for signature validation \nmust be embedded in the signed PDF. These elements can be embedded during the \ndocument signing process or added afterward.  \nIf certa in information is not included in the PDF, the signature can only be validated for a \nlimited time because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. \nWhen a certificate expires, the issuing authority is no longer responsible for  providing \nrevocation status, rendering the signature unverifiable.  \nThe necessary elements for signature validity include the signing certificate chain, certificate \nrevocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If these elements are embedded during signing, \nthe signature can be validated without requiring external resources.  \nAcrobat and Acrobat Reader can embed the necessary elements if available, and the PDF \ncreator must enable usage rights for Acrobat Reader users by going to the hamburger \nmenu    (Windows)  or the  Acrobat  menu (macOS) > Save  as other  > Acrobat  Reader  \nextended  PDF . \nNote:  Embedding timestamp information requires an appropriately configured timestamp \nserver. In addition, the signature validation time must be set to  Secure Time by navigating \nto Preferences  > Security  > Advanced Preferences  > Verification tab. \nCDS certificates can add verification information, such as revocation and timestamp into the \ndocument without requiring any configuration from the signer.
